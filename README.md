# Synacor Challenge Solutions

## Introduction

Synacor Challenge was a set of puzzles where you must implement a virtual machine and solve puzzles inside that VM.

There was a website, but it doesn't exist anymore. However, the specification, data, and hashes of solutions can still be obtained from [github](https://github.com/Aneurysm9/vm_challenge).

This repository provides solutions to each puzzle and an interactive VM.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/pf981/synacore-challenge.git`
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run solutions with `pytest` or open an interactive vm with `python -m vm.py`
